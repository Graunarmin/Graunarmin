### Hi there ðŸ§™

I'm a Computer Science Student, just finished my B.Sc. and starting my M.Sc..
In my studies I already worked on different projects from various fields.
My areas of interest are mainly **Data Science** and **Game Developement**, below I listed some of these projects:
- [Visaulizing Letters of Goethe](https://github.com/Graunarmin/GreatMinds)
- [Visualizing the Spells of the Wizarding World](https://github.com/Graunarmin/VisuProject_HarryPotterSpells)
- Analyzing the [occurence of discourse markers](https://github.com/Graunarmin/Conversational-News_Bachelor) in different types of discourse for my [bachelor's thesis](https://webis.de/for-students/completed-theses.html#sacher_2021)
- The Game [Lost Station](https://github.com/Graunarmin/LostStation) (available on [itch.io](https://graunarmin.itch.io/lost-station))

Currently I am mainly focusing on my Master's degree, on expanding my Python skills and my knowledge in Game Developement.
