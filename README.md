### Hi there ðŸ§™

I'm a Computer Science Student, currently doing my Master's Degree.
In my studies I already worked on different projects from various fields.
My areas of interest are mainly **Data Science** and **Game Developement**. Some of my projects:
- [Visaulizing Letters of Goethe](https://github.com/Graunarmin/GreatMinds)
- [Visualizing the Spells of the Wizarding World](https://github.com/Graunarmin/VisuProject_HarryPotterSpells)
- Analyzing the [occurence of discourse markers](https://github.com/Graunarmin/Conversational-News_Bachelor) in different types of discourse for my [bachelor's thesis](https://webis.de/for-students/completed-theses.html#sacher_2021)
- The 3D Puzzle-Adventure Game [Lost Station](https://github.com/Graunarmin/LostStation) (available on [itch.io](https://graunarmin.itch.io/lost-station))
- The 2D Exploration Game [Island Explorer](https://github.com/Graunarmin/IslandExplorer) (available on [itch.io](https://graunarmin.itch.io/island-explorer))

Currently I am mainly focusing on my Master's degree, on expanding my Python skills and my knowledge in Game Developement.
